# Final assembly of one short in one call: audio (SFX, riser, music, stems, mix) and every compose segment in parallel,
# then the stream-copy concat, verify_final, and delivery into ../edit/short-NN_<slug>/. Alongside the concat it renders the
# thumbnail candidates the graphics marked (gfx/thumbs.json; clean frames, one seek each) -> chk/<sk>_thumbs.png.
#   bash scripts/finish.sh s1 [NN slug]        e.g. bash scripts/finish.sh s1 01 half-the-price-of-opus
# Segments are cached by their inputs: after an edit only the runs that changed are re-rendered (seconds to a minute).
# Run it only after every render_full.sh has printed "done" for this short's graphics (a segment composited while its
# graphic is still being written would be short; the frame-count check catches that and fails).
